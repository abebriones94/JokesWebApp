# JokesWebApp

I began and finished this project to learn how to create a web database app in ASP.NET Core using Visual Studio and C#!

I followed along with a course on YouTube and implemented my own styling to the website. 

Concepts I learned and practiced: 
- Using the MVC design patter
- Configuring database tables using the Entity Framework
- Setting up classes as models
- More practice with Bootstrap classes
